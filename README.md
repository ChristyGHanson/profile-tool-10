## Description
  
This node.js command line application will intake information about a team and generate an HTML webpage that will display profile summaries for each teammate.

### User Story

` AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info

### Acceptance Criteria

`GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input: 
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input

WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address

WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab

WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number

WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team

WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
